STEP 1. Before you can install pyenv on macOS, several other software packages have to be installed before.
        Firstly you need the XCode command line tools, which are installed via the following command:

        i) xcode-select --install

STEP 2. As pyenv builds the Python versions from scratch, some libraries for the build process are required.
        Those libraries can be installed through the package manager Homebrew:

        i) brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib

STEP 3. Installing pyenv on macOS can be done in two ways. The first one is to use the package manager Homebrew:

        i) brew update
        ii) brew install pyenv


                                         OR

        If you donâ€™t want to install pyenv via Homebrew, you can install it directly from the GitHub 
        repository. Enter the following command into your command line to clone the pyenv GitHub repository 
        into your home directory:

        i) git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv


STEP 4. And after the installation has finished successfully, enter the following to add the pyenv to 
        your $PATH and start pyenv when a new terminal window is opened (if you are not using zsh as a shell, 
        you have to change ~/.zshrc accordingly):

        i) echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc
        

STEP 5. After cloning or Installing it you need to enter the following commands to add pyenv to your $PATH and start it 
        when a new terminal window is opened (if you use a different shell than zsh you have to 
        change ~/.zshrc accordingly):

        i) echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
        ii) echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
        iii) echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc
