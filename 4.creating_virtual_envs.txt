STEP 1. To create a new virtual environment for your project, open a terminal in your projectâ€™s root directory. Make sure you set your 
        desired Python version for this project using <pyenv local [PYTHON_VERSION]> then enter:

        i) python -m venv .venv

STEP 2. This command will create a new directory .venv which includes the Python interpreter (provided by 
        pyenv) and all the modules installed using pip later on. After creating the newly created 
        virtual environment,you have to activate it. This is done by entering:

        i)  source .venv/bin/activate

        and for Windows PowerShell:

        ".\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate"


        Now a (.venv) string will appear in front of your command line. After you activate the virtual 
        environment, you can check with which python or get-command python that is now called from 
        the .venv directory. And when you use pip, it also installs all modules into the .venv directory.
        In the rare case you messed up your virtual environment, you can delete the .venv directory and 
        create a new one with python -m venv .venv.
